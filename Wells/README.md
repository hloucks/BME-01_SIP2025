Here are the two data file you can get started with. The first is 20250701_samplelist_chr10.txt, which is your list of samples and their 
associated cenhap groups. 

I have the other dataset stored in a location you can access with an internet connection (it was too large for githubs data limits). Here 
is how you can download that file:

Steps to download data file:
1. On the command line, navigate to the location on your computer where you would like to download the data 
2. Type this command into the command line `wget https://public.gi.ucsc.edu/~hloucks/SIP_2025/Wells/chr10_RepeatMasker.filtered.bed`
